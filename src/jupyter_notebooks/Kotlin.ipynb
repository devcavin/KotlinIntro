    "## Module 3: Loops and Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you need to print \"Hello\" 100 times. You could write `println(\"Hello\")` 100 times, but that would be tedious and impractical. **Loops** are a way to repeat a block of code multiple times automatically. They are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of loops like:\n",
    "- A DJ playing a song on repeat\n",
    "- Doing jumping jacks - you repeat the same motion multiple times\n",
    "- Reading each page in a book from start to finish\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The for Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is used when you know **how many times** you want to repeat something, or when you want to go through items in a list one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Concept: Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the simplest example - counting from 1 to 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..5) {\n",
    "    println(\"Number: $i\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number: 1\n",
    "Number: 2\n",
    "Number: 3\n",
    "Number: 4\n",
    "Number: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening here?**\n",
    "- `for` - This keyword tells Kotlin we're starting a loop\n",
    "- `i` - This is a variable (like a box) that holds the current number. You can name it anything, but `i` is commonly used (short for \"index\" or \"iterator\")\n",
    "- `in` - This means \"going through\" or \"inside\"\n",
    "- `1..5` - This is a **range**, meaning \"from 1 to 5, including both 1 and 5\"\n",
    "- The code inside `{ }` runs once for each number\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting with Different Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you want to count by 2s? (Like: 1, 3, 5, 7...)\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..10 step 2) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step 2` means \"skip one number each time\" or \"jump by 2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting Backwards\n",
    "\n",
    "To count in reverse (like a rocket launch countdown):\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 5 downTo 1) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(\"Blast off!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "4\n",
    "3\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "Blast off!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting Up To (but not including the last number)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to stop *before* reaching a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1 until 5) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice 5 is **not** included. Think of it like \"from 1 up to (but not including) 5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping Through Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In real programs, you often work with lists of items. A **list** is like a shopping list or a to-do list - it's a collection of items in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val fruits = listOf(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for (fruit in fruits) {\n",
    "    println(\"I like $fruit\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I like Apple\n",
    "I like Banana\n",
    "I like Cherry\n",
    "I like Date\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening?**\n",
    "- `listOf(...)` creates a list containing those items\n",
    "- `fruit` is a variable that holds one item at a time\n",
    "- The loop goes through each item in the list, one by one\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting the Position Number (Index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to know which position you're at:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val colors = listOf(\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for (index in colors.indices) {\n",
    "    println(\"Color at position $index is ${colors[index]}\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Color at position 0 is Red\n",
    "Color at position 1 is Green\n",
    "Color at position 2 is Blue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** In programming, we start counting from 0, not 1! So the first item is at position 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val colors = listOf(\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for ((index, color) in colors.withIndex()) {\n",
    "    println(\"Position $index: $color\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Position 0: Red\n",
    "Position 1: Green\n",
    "Position 2: Blue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Calculating Total\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val prices = listOf(10.5, 20.0, 15.75, 8.25)\n",
    "var total = 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "for (price in prices) {\n",
    "    total = total + price  // Add each price to the total\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Total cost: $$total\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total cost: $54.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is used when you **don't know** how many times you need to repeat something. It keeps going as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- \"Keep stirring **while** the sugar hasn't dissolved\"\n",
    "- \"Keep walking **while** you haven't reached home\"\n",
    "- \"Keep playing **while** you're having fun\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "while (condition) {\n",
    "    // Code to repeat\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop checks the condition before each repetition. If it's true, it runs the code. If it's false, it stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example: Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while (count <= 5) {\n",
    "    println(\"Count is: $count\")\n",
    "    count = count + 1  // Very important! This moves us forward\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Count is: 1\n",
    "Count is: 2\n",
    "Count is: 3\n",
    "Count is: 4\n",
    "Count is: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** You must change the variable inside the loop, or it will run forever! (This is called an \"infinite loop\" and is a common beginner mistake)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Password Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var password = \"\"\n",
    "var attempts = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while (password != \"secret123\" && attempts < 3) {\n",
    "    println(\"Enter password:\")\n",
    "    password = readLine() ?: \"\"\n",
    "    attempts = attempts + 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if (password == \"secret123\") {\n",
    "    println(\"Access granted!\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    println(\"Too many failed attempts\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop continues **while** the password is wrong AND attempts are less than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Game Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var playerHealth = 100\n",
    "var round = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while (playerHealth > 0) {\n",
    "    println(\"Round $round: You have $playerHealth health\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Simulate taking damage\n",
    "    playerHealth = playerHealth - 20\n",
    "    round = round + 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Game Over! You survived ${round - 1} rounds\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Round 1: You have 100 health\n",
    "Round 2: You have 80 health\n",
    "Round 3: You have 60 health\n",
    "Round 4: You have 40 health\n",
    "Round 5: You have 20 health\n",
    "Game Over! You survived 5 rounds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The do-while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `do-while` loop is similar to `while`, but with one key difference: **it always runs at least once**, even if the condition is false from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- \"Do your homework first, then check if you can play\"\n",
    "- \"Take one step, then check if you've arrived\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "do {\n",
    "    // Code to repeat\n",
    "} while (condition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Always Runs Once\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "do {\n",
    "    println(\"This runs at least once: $x\")\n",
    "} while (x < 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "This runs at least once: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `x` is 10 (which is NOT less than 5), the code inside runs once before checking the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare with regular `while`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "while (x < 5) {\n",
    "    println(\"This never runs: $x\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** (nothing prints because the condition is false from the start)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Menu System\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var choice = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "do {\n",
    "    println(\"\\n--- Menu ---\")\n",
    "    println(\"1. Start Game\")\n",
    "    println(\"2. Options\")\n",
    "    println(\"3. Exit\")\n",
    "    println(\"Enter your choice:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    choice = readLine()?.toIntOrNull() ?: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    when (choice) {\n",
    "        1 -> println(\"Starting game...\")\n",
    "        2 -> println(\"Opening options...\")\n",
    "        3 -> println(\"Goodbye!\")\n",
    "        else -> println(\"Invalid choice, try again\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "} while (choice != 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the menu at least once, then keeps showing it until the user chooses 3 (Exit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary: When to Use Each Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "| Loop Type | When to Use | Example Use Case |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **for** | You know how many times to repeat | Going through a list, counting 1 to 10 |\n",
    "| **while** | You don't know how many times, depends on a condition | Keep trying until success, game loops |\n",
    "| **do-while** | Same as while, but must run at least once | Menu systems, \"try at least once\" scenarios |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to change how a loop behaves while it's running. These special commands help you control the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The break Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Immediately stops the loop and exits it completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- Pressing the emergency stop button\n",
    "- Finding what you're looking for and stopping the search\n",
    "- Breaking out of a while loop when a condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..10) {\n",
    "    if (i == 6) {\n",
    "        break  // Stop the loop when i equals 6\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(\"Loop ended\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "Loop ended\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop stops as soon as `i` becomes 6. It never prints 6 or continues to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Finding an Item\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val names = listOf(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\")\n",
    "var found = false\n",
    "\n",
    "for (name in names) {\n",
    "    if (name == \"Charlie\") {\n",
    "        println(\"Found Charlie!\")\n",
    "        found = true\n",
    "        break  // Stop searching once we find Charlie\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if (!found) {\n",
    "    println(\"Charlie not found\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Found Charlie!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find \"Charlie\", there's no need to keep looking, so we `break` out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breaking from Nested Loops (Loops Inside Loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you have a loop inside another loop (like looking through rows and columns in a grid):\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (row in 1..3) {\n",
    "    for (col in 1..3) {\n",
    "        if (row == 2 && col == 2) {\n",
    "            break  // This only breaks the inner loop\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        println(\"Row $row, Column $col\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you want to break out of BOTH loops? Use **labels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "outerLoop@ for (row in 1..3) {\n",
    "    for (col in 1..3) {\n",
    "        if (row == 2 && col == 2) {\n",
    "            break@outerLoop  // Break out of the outer loop\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        println(\"Row $row, Column $col\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(\"Completely done\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Row 1, Column 1\n",
    "Row 1, Column 2\n",
    "Row 1, Column 3\n",
    "Row 2, Column 1\n",
    "Completely done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `outerLoop@` is a label (you can name it anything). `break@outerLoop` tells Kotlin to break out of that specific labeled loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The continue Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- Skipping a song you don't like\n",
    "- Skipping spoiled fruit while picking good ones\n",
    "- \"Skip this one and move to the next\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..5) {\n",
    "    if (i == 3) {\n",
    "        continue  // Skip when i equals 3\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that 3 is missing. When `i` equals 3, `continue` skips the `println` and goes directly to the next iteration (i = 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Processing Only Valid Items\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val scores = listOf(85, -1, 92, 0, 78, -5, 88)\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Valid scores:\")\n",
    "for (score in scores) {\n",
    "    if (score < 0) {\n",
    "        continue  // Skip invalid (negative) scores\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(\"Score: $score\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Valid scores:\n",
    "Score: 85\n",
    "Score: 92\n",
    "Score: 0\n",
    "Score: 78\n",
    "Score: 88\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another Example: Skipping Even Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "println(\"Odd numbers from 1 to 10:\")\n",
    "for (i in 1..10) {\n",
    "    if (i % 2 == 0) {\n",
    "        continue  // Skip even numbers\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Odd numbers from 1 to 10:\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `%` is the modulo operator - it gives you the remainder after division. `i % 2 == 0` means \"i is even\" (because even numbers have no remainder when divided by 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Labels with continue\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like `break`, you can use labels with `continue`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "outer@ for (i in 1..3) {\n",
    "    for (j in 1..3) {\n",
    "        if (j == 2) {\n",
    "            continue@outer  // Skip to next iteration of outer loop\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        println(\"i: $i, j: $j\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "i: 1, j: 1\n",
    "i: 2, j: 1\n",
    "i: 3, j: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The return Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Exits from a function completely and optionally sends a value back.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll understand this better when we learn about functions in the next module, but here's a preview:\n",
    "\n",

    "fun findFirstEvenNumber(numbers: List<Int>): Int? {\n",
    "    for (num in numbers) {\n",
    "        if (num % 2 == 0) {\n",
    "            return num  // Found it! Exit the function and return this number\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return null  // Didn't find any even number\n",

    "## Module 4: Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you need to calculate the area of a rectangle multiple times in your program. Instead of writing `length * width` every time, you can create a **function** - a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of functions like:\n",
    "- **Recipes:** A recipe is a set of instructions you can follow multiple times to make the same dish\n",
    "- **Appliances:** A microwave is a \"heat food function\" - you put food in, press a button, and get heated food out\n",
    "- **Vending machines:** Put money in (input), select item, get snack out (output)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use functions?**\n",
    "- **Avoid repetition:** Write code once, use it many times\n",
    "- **Organization:** Break big problems into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Use the same function in different parts of your program\n",
    "- **Easier to fix:** If there's a problem, you only need to fix it in one place\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Function Declaration & Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Simplest Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a function that prints a greeting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun sayHello() {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `fun` - This keyword tells Kotlin we're creating a function\n",
    "- `sayHello` - This is the name of the function (you can name it anything meaningful)\n",
    "- `()` - These parentheses hold parameters (inputs), which we'll learn about soon\n",
    "- `{ }` - The code inside these braces is what the function does\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling (Using) a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a function, you \"call\" it by writing its name followed by parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun sayHello() {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now let's use it:\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrote the code once but used it three times!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Function Parameters & Return Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions with Inputs (Parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most functions need some information to work with. These are called **parameters** or **arguments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun greetPerson(name: String) {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, $name! Nice to meet you.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "greetPerson(\"Alice\")\n",
    "greetPerson(\"Bob\")\n",
    "greetPerson(\"Charlie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.\n",
    "Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you.\n",
    "Hello, Charlie! Nice to meet you.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening:**\n",
    "- `name: String` - This is a parameter. `name` is the variable name, and `String` is its type (text)\n",
    "- When we call `greetPerson(\"Alice\")`, the value \"Alice\" is passed to the function and stored in `name`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take multiple inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun introducePerson(name: String, age: Int, city: String) {\n",
    "    println(\"This is $name, they are $age years old and live in $city.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "introducePerson(\"Emma\", 25, \"New York\")\n",
    "introducePerson(\"James\", 30, \"London\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is Emma, they are 25 years old and live in New York.\n",
    "This is James, they are 30 years old and live in London.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common data types:**\n",
    "- `String` - Text (words, sentences)\n",
    "- `Int` - Whole numbers (1, 42, -5)\n",
    "- `Double` - Decimal numbers (3.14, -0.5)\n",
    "- `Boolean` - True or false\n",
    "- `Char` - Single character ('A', 'x')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions with Outputs (Return Values)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our functions have just printed things. But often you want a function to **calculate** something and give you the result back. This is called **returning a value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun addNumbers(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val sum = addNumbers(5, 3)\n",
    "println(\"The sum is: $sum\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sum is: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `: Int` after the parentheses tells Kotlin this function returns an integer\n",
    "- `return a + b` calculates the sum and sends it back\n",
    "- We store the result in `sum` and can use it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Return Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Calculate rectangle area\n",
    "fun calculateArea(width: Double, height: Double): Double {\n",
    "    return width * height\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val area = calculateArea(5.0, 3.0)\n",
    "println(\"Area: $area square units\")  // Output: Area: 15.0 square units\n",
    "\n",
    "// Check if number is even\n",
    "fun isEven(number: Int): Boolean {\n",
    "    return number % 2 == 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(isEven(4))   // Output: true\n",
    "println(isEven(7))   // Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get the larger of two numbers\n",
    "fun maximum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    if (a > b) {\n",
    "        return a\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        return b\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Max of 10 and 25: ${maximum(10, 25)}\")  // Output: Max of 10 and 25: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions That Don't Return Anything\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function just performs an action (like printing) and doesn't give back a value, you can omit the return type (or write `: Unit`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun printDivider() {\n",
    "    println(\"====================\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// These are equivalent:\n",
    "fun printDivider2(): Unit {\n",
    "    println(\"====================\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returning Multiple Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to return more than one value. You can use a `Pair` (for 2 values) or create a data class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Using Pair for 2 values\n",
    "fun getMinAndMax(numbers: List<Int>): Pair<Int, Int> {\n",
    "    val min = numbers.minOrNull() ?: 0\n",
    "    val max = numbers.maxOrNull() ?: 0\n",
    "    return Pair(min, max)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val (minimum, maximum) = getMinAndMax(listOf(3, 7, 2, 9, 1))\n",
    "println(\"Min: $minimum, Max: $maximum\")  // Output: Min: 1, Max: 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Default & Named Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Default Arguments (Optional Parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want a parameter to have a default value if the user doesn't provide one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun greetWithTitle(name: String, title: String = \"Mr./Ms.\") {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, $title $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "greetWithTitle(\"Smith\")              // Uses default title\n",
    "greetWithTitle(\"Johnson\", \"Dr.\")     // Uses provided title\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Mr./Ms. Smith!\n",
    "Hello, Dr. Johnson!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Creating User Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun createUser(\n",
    "    name: String,\n",
    "    age: Int = 18,\n",
    "    country: String = \"Not specified\",\n",
    "    isPremium: Boolean = false\n",
    ") {\n",
    "    println(\"Creating user: $name\")\n",
    "    println(\"Age: $age\")\n",
    "    println(\"Country: $country\")\n",
    "    println(\"Premium: $isPremium\")\n",
    "    println(\"---\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using defaults for most parameters\n",
    "createUser(\"Alice\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Providing some parameters\n",
    "createUser(\"Bob\", age = 25, country = \"USA\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Providing all parameters\n",
    "createUser(\"Charlie\", 30, \"UK\", true)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Creating user: Alice\n",
    "Age: 18\n",
    "Country: Not specified\n",
    "Premium: false\n",
    "---\n",
    "Creating user: Bob\n",
    "Age: 25\n",
    "Country: USA\n",
    "Premium: false\n",
    "---\n",
    "Creating user: Charlie\n",
    "Age: 30\n",
    "Country: UK\n",
    "Premium: true\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Named Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function has many parameters, you can specify which parameter you're setting by name. This makes code clearer and lets you skip parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun bookHotel(\n",
    "    hotelName: String,\n",
    "    nights: Int,\n",
    "    roomType: String = \"Standard\",\n",
    "    breakfast: Boolean = false\n",
    ") {\n",
    "    println(\"Booking $hotelName for $nights nights\")\n",
    "    println(\"Room: $roomType, Breakfast: $breakfast\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Named arguments - you can put them in any order!\n",
    "bookHotel(\n",
    "    hotelName = \"Grand Hotel\",\n",
    "    nights = 3,\n",
    "    breakfast = true\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Skip parameters in the middle\n",
    "bookHotel(\n",
    "    hotelName = \"Beach Resort\",\n",
    "    nights = 5,\n",
    "    breakfast = true\n",
    "    // roomType uses default \"Standard\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Single-expression Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function simply calculates and returns something in one line, you can make it shorter:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular way:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun double(x: Int): Int {\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short way (single-expression):**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun double(x: Int): Int = x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even shorter (Kotlin can figure out the return type):\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun double(x: Int) = x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Calculate square\n",
    "fun square(x: Int) = x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "// Check if positive\n",
    "fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get greeting message\n",
    "fun getGreeting(name: String) = \"Welcome back, $name!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// Calculate circle area\n",
    "fun circleArea(radius: Double) = 3.14159 * radius * radius\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using them:\n",
    "println(square(5))              // Output: 25\n",
    "println(isPositive(-3))         // Output: false\n",
    "println(getGreeting(\"Alice\"))   // Output: Welcome back, Alice!\n",
    "println(circleArea(5.0))        // Output: 78.53975\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use single-expression functions:**\n",
    "- The function is simple (one calculation or operation)\n",
    "- It makes the code more readable (not more confusing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Vararg Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you don't know how many arguments will be passed to a function. The `vararg` keyword lets you accept any number of arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun printAllNames(vararg names: String) {\n",
    "    for (name in names) {\n",
    "        println(\"Hello, $name\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "printAllNames(\"Alice\")                      // 1 argument\n",
    "printAllNames(\"Bob\", \"Charlie\")             // 2 arguments\n",
    "printAllNames(\"David\", \"Eve\", \"Frank\", \"Grace\")  // 4 arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice\n",
    "Hello, Bob\n",
    "Hello, Charlie\n",
    "Hello, David\n",
    "Hello, Eve\n",
    "Hello, Frank\n",
    "Hello, Grace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Calculating Average\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun calculateAverage(vararg numbers: Int): Double {\n",
    "    if (numbers.isEmpty()) {\n",
    "        return 0.0\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    var sum = 0\n",
    "    for (num in numbers) {\n",
    "        sum += num\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return sum.toDouble() / numbers.size\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Average of 10, 20, 30: ${calculateAverage(10, 20, 30)}\")\n",
    "println(\"Average of 5, 15: ${calculateAverage(5, 15)}\")\n",
    "println(\"Average of 100: ${calculateAverage(100)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Average of 10, 20, 30: 20.0\n",
    "Average of 5, 15: 10.0\n",
    "Average of 100: 100.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining Vararg with Other Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun printReport(title: String, vararg items: String) {\n",
    "    println(\"=== $title ===\")\n",
    "    for (item in items) {\n",
    "        println(\"- $item\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "printReport(\"Shopping List\", \"Milk\", \"Bread\", \"Eggs\", \"Cheese\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "=== Shopping List ===\n",
    "- Milk\n",
    "- Bread\n",
    "- Eggs\n",
    "- Cheese\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Inline Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for beginners:** This is a more advanced topic. You don't need to fully understand it now, but it's good to know it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline functions are a performance optimization. When you mark a function as `inline`, Kotlin copies the function's code to wherever it's called, instead of actually calling the function. This makes the program slightly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "inline fun measureTime(action: () -> Unit) {\n",
    "    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\n",
    "    action()\n",
    "    val endTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\n",
    "    println(\"Time taken: ${endTime - startTime} milliseconds\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "measureTime {\n",
    "    // Some task\n",
    "    var sum = 0\n",
    "    for (i in 1..1000000) {\n",
    "        sum += i\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(\"Sum: $sum\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For now, just remember:** Inline functions exist and are used for performance. You'll rarely need to create them as a beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Higher-order Functions & Lambdas\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds complicated, but it's actually a very powerful and useful concept!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Higher-order Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **higher-order function** is simply a function that:\n",
    "- Takes another function as a parameter, OR\n",
    "- Returns a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like: \"A function that works with other functions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **lambda** is a quick way to write a small function without giving it a name. Think of it as an \"anonymous function\" or \"function on the go\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to perform different operations on two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {\n",
    "    return operation(a, b)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now we can use it with different operations:\n",
    "val sum = calculate(5, 3, { x, y -> x + y })\n",
    "println(\"Sum: $sum\")  // Output: Sum: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "val product = calculate(5, 3, { x, y -> x * y })\n",
    "println(\"Product: $product\")  // Output: Product: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `operation: (Int, Int) -> Int` means \"a parameter that is a function taking two Ints and returning an Int\"\n",
    "- `{ x, y -> x + y }` is a lambda - a small unnamed function that adds two numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaner Lambda Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "When a lambda is the last parameter, you can write it outside the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val sum = calculate(5, 3) { x, y -> x + y }\n",
    "val difference = calculate(10, 3) { x, y -> x - y }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Filtering a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get only even numbers\n",
    "val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { number -> number % 2 == 0 }\n",
    "println(\"Even numbers: $evenNumbers\")\n",
    "// Output: Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",

    "\n",
    "// Instead of:\n",

    "### 8. Extension Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension functions let you add new functions to existing types (like String, Int, List) without modifying their original code. It's like adding new abilities to something that already exists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- Adding a new feature to your phone through a software update\n",
    "- Teaching an old dog a new trick\n",
    "- Adding a new tool to your toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a function to String that adds exclamation marks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun String.addExclamation(): String {\n",
    "    return this + \"!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now you can use it on any String:\n",
    "val greeting = \"Hello\"\n",
    "println(greeting.addExclamation())  // Output: Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "fun String.addExclamation(): String {\n",
    "    return this + \"!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now you can use it on any String:\n",
    "val greeting = \"Hello\"\n",
    "println(greeting.addExclamation())  // Output: Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "val message = \"Welcome to Kotlin\"\n",
    "println(message.addExclamation())   // Output: Welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `fun String.addExclamation()` - We're adding a function called `addExclamation` to the `String` type\n",
    "- `this` - Inside the extension function, `this` refers to the String object you're calling it on\n",
    "- Now every String in your program has this new ability!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Useful Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Add a function to Int to check if it's between two values\n",
    "fun Int.isBetween(min: Int, max: Int): Boolean {\n",
    "    return this >= min && this <= max\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val age = 25\n",
    "println(age.isBetween(18, 30))  // Output: true\n",
    "println(age.isBetween(30, 40))  // Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to repeat a String multiple times\n",
    "fun String.repeatTimes(count: Int): String {\n",
    "    var result = \"\"\n",
    "    for (i in 1..count) {\n",
    "        result += this\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Ha\".repeatTimes(3))  // Output: HaHaHa\n",
    "println(\"* \".repeatTimes(5))  // Output: * * * * *\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to check if a String is a valid email (simplified)\n",
    "fun String.isValidEmail(): Boolean {\n",
    "    return this.contains(\"@\") && this.contains(\".\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"user@example.com\".isValidEmail())  // Output: true\n",
    "println(\"invalid-email\".isValidEmail())     // Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to get first character safely\n",
    "fun String.firstCharOrDefault(default: Char = ' '): Char {\n",
    "    return if (this.isNotEmpty()) this[0] else default\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Kotlin\".firstCharOrDefault())  // Output: K\n",
    "println(\"\".firstCharOrDefault('X'))     // Output: X\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension Functions for Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Add a function to get the second item in a list (if it exists)\n",
    "fun <T> List<T>.secondOrNull(): T? {\n",
    "    return if (this.size >= 2) this[1] else null\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val fruits = listOf(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\")\n",
    "println(fruits.secondOrNull())  // Output: Banana\n",
    "\n",
    "val shortList = listOf(\"Only one\")\n",
    "println(shortList.secondOrNull())  // Output: null\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to calculate average of numbers\n",
    "fun List<Int>.average(): Double {\n",
    "    if (this.isEmpty()) return 0.0\n",
    "    return this.sum().toDouble() / this.size\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val scores = listOf(85, 90, 78, 92, 88)\n",
    "println(\"Average score: ${scores.average()}\")  // Output: Average score: 86.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: String Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Convert string to title case (first letter of each word capitalized)\n",

    "#### Why Extension Functions Are Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cleaner code:** Instead of utility functions, you can call methods directly\n",
    "2. **Intuitive:** Feels like the function was always part of the type\n",
    "3. **Organized:** Keep related functions together\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare these two approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Without extension function (old way):\n",
    "fun isEven(number: Int): Boolean {\n",
    "    return number % 2 == 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if (isEven(myNumber)) {\n",
    "    println(\"Even\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// With extension function (new way):\n",
    "fun Int.isEven(): Boolean {\n",
    "    return this % 2 == 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if (myNumber.isEven()) {\n",
    "    println(\"Even\")\n",

    "## Common Beginner Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Infinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var count = 1\n",
    "while (count <= 5) {\n",
    "    println(count)\n",
    "    // Forgot to increment count!\n",
    "}\n",
    "// This runs forever!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Always make sure your loop variable changes!\n",

    "var count = 1\n",
    "while (count <= 5) {\n",
    "    println(count)\n",
    "    count++  // Don't forget this!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Off-by-One Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Want to print 1 to 10, but this prints 1 to 9\n",
    "for (i in 1 until 10) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `..` for inclusive ranges\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..10) {  // Includes both 1 and 10\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Forgetting Return Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    a * b  // Result is calculated but not returned!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `return`\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "}\n",

    "### Mistake 4: Wrong Parameter Order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun divide(dividend: Int, divisor: Int) = dividend / divisor\n",
    "\n",
    "divide(2, 10)  // Oops! This calculates 2/10, not 10/2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use named arguments for clarity\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "divide(dividend = 10, divisor = 2)  // Clear: 10/2 = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 5: Modifying Collections While Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",

    "# Kotlin: Loops and Functions - Beginner's Complete Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module 3: Loops and Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you need to print \"Hello\" 100 times. You could write `println(\"Hello\")` 100 times, but that would be tedious and impractical. **Loops** are a way to repeat a block of code multiple times automatically. They are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of loops like:\n",
    "- A DJ playing a song on repeat\n",
    "- Doing jumping jacks - you repeat the same motion multiple times\n",
    "- Reading each page in a book from start to finish\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The for Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is used when you know **how many times** you want to repeat something, or when you want to go through items in a list one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Concept: Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the simplest example - counting from 1 to 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..5) {\n",
    "    println(\"Number: $i\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number: 1\n",
    "Number: 2\n",
    "Number: 3\n",
    "Number: 4\n",
    "Number: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening here?**\n",
    "- `for` - This keyword tells Kotlin we're starting a loop\n",
    "- `i` - This is a variable (like a box) that holds the current number. You can name it anything, but `i` is commonly used (short for \"index\" or \"iterator\")\n",
    "- `in` - This means \"going through\" or \"inside\"\n",
    "- `1..5` - This is a **range**, meaning \"from 1 to 5, including both 1 and 5\"\n",
    "- The code inside `{ }` runs once for each number\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting with Different Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you want to count by 2s? (Like: 1, 3, 5, 7...)\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..10 step 2) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step 2` means \"skip one number each time\" or \"jump by 2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting Backwards\n",
    "\n",
    "To count in reverse (like a rocket launch countdown):\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 5 downTo 1) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(\"Blast off!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "4\n",
    "3\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "Blast off!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting Up To (but not including the last number)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to stop *before* reaching a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1 until 5) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice 5 is **not** included. Think of it like \"from 1 up to (but not including) 5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping Through Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In real programs, you often work with lists of items. A **list** is like a shopping list or a to-do list - it's a collection of items in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val fruits = listOf(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for (fruit in fruits) {\n",
    "    println(\"I like $fruit\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I like Apple\n",
    "I like Banana\n",
    "I like Cherry\n",
    "I like Date\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening?**\n",
    "- `listOf(...)` creates a list containing those items\n",
    "- `fruit` is a variable that holds one item at a time\n",
    "- The loop goes through each item in the list, one by one\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting the Position Number (Index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to know which position you're at:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val colors = listOf(\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for (index in colors.indices) {\n",
    "    println(\"Color at position $index is ${colors[index]}\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Color at position 0 is Red\n",
    "Color at position 1 is Green\n",
    "Color at position 2 is Blue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** In programming, we start counting from 0, not 1! So the first item is at position 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val colors = listOf(\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for ((index, color) in colors.withIndex()) {\n",
    "    println(\"Position $index: $color\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Position 0: Red\n",
    "Position 1: Green\n",
    "Position 2: Blue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Calculating Total\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val prices = listOf(10.5, 20.0, 15.75, 8.25)\n",
    "var total = 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "for (price in prices) {\n",
    "    total = total + price  // Add each price to the total\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Total cost: $$total\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total cost: $54.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is used when you **don't know** how many times you need to repeat something. It keeps going as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- \"Keep stirring **while** the sugar hasn't dissolved\"\n",
    "- \"Keep walking **while** you haven't reached home\"\n",
    "- \"Keep playing **while** you're having fun\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "while (condition) {\n",
    "    // Code to repeat\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop checks the condition before each repetition. If it's true, it runs the code. If it's false, it stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example: Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while (count <= 5) {\n",
    "    println(\"Count is: $count\")\n",
    "    count = count + 1  // Very important! This moves us forward\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Count is: 1\n",
    "Count is: 2\n",
    "Count is: 3\n",
    "Count is: 4\n",
    "Count is: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** You must change the variable inside the loop, or it will run forever! (This is called an \"infinite loop\" and is a common beginner mistake)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Password Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var password = \"\"\n",
    "var attempts = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while (password != \"secret123\" && attempts < 3) {\n",
    "    println(\"Enter password:\")\n",
    "    password = readLine() ?: \"\"\n",
    "    attempts = attempts + 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if (password == \"secret123\") {\n",
    "    println(\"Access granted!\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    println(\"Too many failed attempts\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop continues **while** the password is wrong AND attempts are less than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Game Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var playerHealth = 100\n",
    "var round = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while (playerHealth > 0) {\n",
    "    println(\"Round $round: You have $playerHealth health\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Simulate taking damage\n",
    "    playerHealth = playerHealth - 20\n",
    "    round = round + 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Game Over! You survived ${round - 1} rounds\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Round 1: You have 100 health\n",
    "Round 2: You have 80 health\n",
    "Round 3: You have 60 health\n",
    "Round 4: You have 40 health\n",
    "Round 5: You have 20 health\n",
    "Game Over! You survived 5 rounds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The do-while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `do-while` loop is similar to `while`, but with one key difference: **it always runs at least once**, even if the condition is false from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- \"Do your homework first, then check if you can play\"\n",
    "- \"Take one step, then check if you've arrived\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "do {\n",
    "    // Code to repeat\n",
    "} while (condition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Always Runs Once\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "do {\n",
    "    println(\"This runs at least once: $x\")\n",
    "} while (x < 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "This runs at least once: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `x` is 10 (which is NOT less than 5), the code inside runs once before checking the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare with regular `while`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var x = 10\n",
    "\n",

    "| Loop Type | When to Use | Example Use Case |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **for** | You know how many times to repeat | Going through a list, counting 1 to 10 |\n",
    "| **while** | You don't know how many times, depends on a condition | Keep trying until success, game loops |\n",

    "## Loop Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to change how a loop behaves while it's running. These special commands help you control the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The break Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Immediately stops the loop and exits it completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- Pressing the emergency stop button\n",
    "- Finding what you're looking for and stopping the search\n",
    "- Breaking out of a while loop when a condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..10) {\n",
    "    if (i == 6) {\n",
    "        break  // Stop the loop when i equals 6\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(\"Loop ended\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "Loop ended\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop stops as soon as `i` becomes 6. It never prints 6 or continues to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Finding an Item\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val names = listOf(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\")\n",
    "var found = false\n",
    "\n",
    "for (name in names) {\n",
    "    if (name == \"Charlie\") {\n",
    "        println(\"Found Charlie!\")\n",
    "        found = true\n",
    "        break  // Stop searching once we find Charlie\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if (!found) {\n",
    "    println(\"Charlie not found\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Found Charlie!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find \"Charlie\", there's no need to keep looking, so we `break` out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breaking from Nested Loops (Loops Inside Loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you have a loop inside another loop (like looking through rows and columns in a grid):\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (row in 1..3) {\n",
    "    for (col in 1..3) {\n",
    "        if (row == 2 && col == 2) {\n",
    "            break  // This only breaks the inner loop\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        println(\"Row $row, Column $col\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you want to break out of BOTH loops? Use **labels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "outerLoop@ for (row in 1..3) {\n",
    "    for (col in 1..3) {\n",
    "        if (row == 2 && col == 2) {\n",
    "            break@outerLoop  // Break out of the outer loop\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        println(\"Row $row, Column $col\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(\"Completely done\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Row 1, Column 1\n",
    "Row 1, Column 2\n",
    "Row 1, Column 3\n",
    "Row 2, Column 1\n",
    "Completely done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `outerLoop@` is a label (you can name it anything). `break@outerLoop` tells Kotlin to break out of that specific labeled loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The continue Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- Skipping a song you don't like\n",
    "- Skipping spoiled fruit while picking good ones\n",
    "- \"Skip this one and move to the next\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..5) {\n",
    "    if (i == 3) {\n",
    "        continue  // Skip when i equals 3\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that 3 is missing. When `i` equals 3, `continue` skips the `println` and goes directly to the next iteration (i = 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Processing Only Valid Items\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val scores = listOf(85, -1, 92, 0, 78, -5, 88)\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Valid scores:\")\n",
    "for (score in scores) {\n",
    "    if (score < 0) {\n",
    "        continue  // Skip invalid (negative) scores\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(\"Score: $score\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Valid scores:\n",
    "Score: 85\n",
    "Score: 92\n",
    "Score: 0\n",
    "Score: 78\n",
    "Score: 88\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another Example: Skipping Even Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "println(\"Odd numbers from 1 to 10:\")\n",
    "for (i in 1..10) {\n",
    "    if (i % 2 == 0) {\n",
    "        continue  // Skip even numbers\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Odd numbers from 1 to 10:\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `%` is the modulo operator - it gives you the remainder after division. `i % 2 == 0` means \"i is even\" (because even numbers have no remainder when divided by 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Labels with continue\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like `break`, you can use labels with `continue`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "outer@ for (i in 1..3) {\n",
    "    for (j in 1..3) {\n",
    "        if (j == 2) {\n",
    "            continue@outer  // Skip to next iteration of outer loop\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        println(\"i: $i, j: $j\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "i: 1, j: 1\n",
    "i: 2, j: 1\n",
    "i: 3, j: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The return Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Exits from a function completely and optionally sends a value back.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll understand this better when we learn about functions in the next module, but here's a preview:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun findFirstEvenNumber(numbers: List<Int>): Int? {\n",
    "    for (num in numbers) {\n",
    "        if (num % 2 == 0) {\n",
    "            return num  // Found it! Exit the function and return this number\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return null  // Didn't find any even number\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val result = findFirstEvenNumber(listOf(1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11))\n",
    "println(\"First even number: $result\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "First even number: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function stops as soon as it finds the first even number (8) and returns it immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference: break vs continue vs return\n",
    "\n",
    "| Statement | What It Does | Analogy |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|---------|\n",
    "| **break** | Exit the loop completely | Leave the building |\n",
    "| **continue** | Skip to the next iteration | Skip to the next song |\n",
    "| **return** | Exit the entire function | Go home (leave everything) |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module 4: Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you need to calculate the area of a rectangle multiple times in your program. Instead of writing `length * width` every time, you can create a **function** - a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of functions like:\n",
    "- **Recipes:** A recipe is a set of instructions you can follow multiple times to make the same dish\n",
    "- **Appliances:** A microwave is a \"heat food function\" - you put food in, press a button, and get heated food out\n",
    "- **Vending machines:** Put money in (input), select item, get snack out (output)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use functions?**\n",
    "- **Avoid repetition:** Write code once, use it many times\n",
    "- **Organization:** Break big problems into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Use the same function in different parts of your program\n",
    "- **Easier to fix:** If there's a problem, you only need to fix it in one place\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Function Declaration & Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Simplest Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a function that prints a greeting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun sayHello() {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `fun` - This keyword tells Kotlin we're creating a function\n",
    "- `sayHello` - This is the name of the function (you can name it anything meaningful)\n",
    "- `()` - These parentheses hold parameters (inputs), which we'll learn about soon\n",
    "- `{ }` - The code inside these braces is what the function does\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling (Using) a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a function, you \"call\" it by writing its name followed by parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun sayHello() {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now let's use it:\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "sayHello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "Hello, welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrote the code once but used it three times!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Function Parameters & Return Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions with Inputs (Parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most functions need some information to work with. These are called **parameters** or **arguments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun greetPerson(name: String) {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, $name! Nice to meet you.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "greetPerson(\"Alice\")\n",
    "greetPerson(\"Bob\")\n",
    "greetPerson(\"Charlie\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.\n",
    "Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you.\n",
    "Hello, Charlie! Nice to meet you.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening:**\n",
    "- `name: String` - This is a parameter. `name` is the variable name, and `String` is its type (text)\n",
    "- When we call `greetPerson(\"Alice\")`, the value \"Alice\" is passed to the function and stored in `name`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take multiple inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun introducePerson(name: String, age: Int, city: String) {\n",
    "    println(\"This is $name, they are $age years old and live in $city.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "introducePerson(\"Emma\", 25, \"New York\")\n",
    "introducePerson(\"James\", 30, \"London\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is Emma, they are 25 years old and live in New York.\n",
    "This is James, they are 30 years old and live in London.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common data types:**\n",
    "- `String` - Text (words, sentences)\n",
    "- `Int` - Whole numbers (1, 42, -5)\n",
    "- `Double` - Decimal numbers (3.14, -0.5)\n",
    "- `Boolean` - True or false\n",
    "- `Char` - Single character ('A', 'x')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions with Outputs (Return Values)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our functions have just printed things. But often you want a function to **calculate** something and give you the result back. This is called **returning a value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun addNumbers(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val sum = addNumbers(5, 3)\n",
    "println(\"The sum is: $sum\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sum is: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `: Int` after the parentheses tells Kotlin this function returns an integer\n",
    "- `return a + b` calculates the sum and sends it back\n",
    "- We store the result in `sum` and can use it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Return Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Calculate rectangle area\n",
    "fun calculateArea(width: Double, height: Double): Double {\n",
    "    return width * height\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val area = calculateArea(5.0, 3.0)\n",
    "println(\"Area: $area square units\")  // Output: Area: 15.0 square units\n",
    "\n",
    "// Check if number is even\n",
    "fun isEven(number: Int): Boolean {\n",
    "    return number % 2 == 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(isEven(4))   // Output: true\n",
    "println(isEven(7))   // Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get the larger of two numbers\n",
    "fun maximum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    if (a > b) {\n",
    "        return a\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        return b\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Max of 10 and 25: ${maximum(10, 25)}\")  // Output: Max of 10 and 25: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions That Don't Return Anything\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function just performs an action (like printing) and doesn't give back a value, you can omit the return type (or write `: Unit`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun printDivider() {\n",
    "    println(\"====================\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// These are equivalent:\n",
    "fun printDivider2(): Unit {\n",
    "    println(\"====================\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returning Multiple Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to return more than one value. You can use a `Pair` (for 2 values) or create a data class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Using Pair for 2 values\n",
    "fun getMinAndMax(numbers: List<Int>): Pair<Int, Int> {\n",
    "    val min = numbers.minOrNull() ?: 0\n",
    "    val max = numbers.maxOrNull() ?: 0\n",
    "    return Pair(min, max)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val (minimum, maximum) = getMinAndMax(listOf(3, 7, 2, 9, 1))\n",
    "println(\"Min: $minimum, Max: $maximum\")  // Output: Min: 1, Max: 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Default & Named Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Default Arguments (Optional Parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want a parameter to have a default value if the user doesn't provide one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun greetWithTitle(name: String, title: String = \"Mr./Ms.\") {\n",
    "    println(\"Hello, $title $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "greetWithTitle(\"Smith\")              // Uses default title\n",
    "greetWithTitle(\"Johnson\", \"Dr.\")     // Uses provided title\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Mr./Ms. Smith!\n",
    "Hello, Dr. Johnson!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Creating User Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun createUser(\n",
    "    name: String,\n",

    "#### Named Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function has many parameters, you can specify which parameter you're setting by name. This makes code clearer and lets you skip parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",

    "    // roomType uses default \"Standard\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Single-expression Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function simply calculates and returns something in one line, you can make it shorter:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular way:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun double(x: Int): Int {\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short way (single-expression):**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun double(x: Int): Int = x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even shorter (Kotlin can figure out the return type):\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun double(x: Int) = x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Calculate square\n",
    "fun square(x: Int) = x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "// Check if positive\n",
    "fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get greeting message\n",
    "fun getGreeting(name: String) = \"Welcome back, $name!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// Calculate circle area\n",
    "fun circleArea(radius: Double) = 3.14159 * radius * radius\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using them:\n",
    "println(square(5))              // Output: 25\n",
    "println(isPositive(-3))         // Output: false\n",
    "println(getGreeting(\"Alice\"))   // Output: Welcome back, Alice!\n",
    "println(circleArea(5.0))        // Output: 78.53975\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use single-expression functions:**\n",
    "- The function is simple (one calculation or operation)\n",
    "- It makes the code more readable (not more confusing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Vararg Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you don't know how many arguments will be passed to a function. The `vararg` keyword lets you accept any number of arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun printAllNames(vararg names: String) {\n",
    "    for (name in names) {\n",
    "        println(\"Hello, $name\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "printAllNames(\"Alice\")                      // 1 argument\n",
    "printAllNames(\"Bob\", \"Charlie\")             // 2 arguments\n",
    "printAllNames(\"David\", \"Eve\", \"Frank\", \"Grace\")  // 4 arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice\n",
    "Hello, Bob\n",
    "Hello, Charlie\n",
    "Hello, David\n",
    "Hello, Eve\n",
    "Hello, Frank\n",
    "Hello, Grace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Calculating Average\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun calculateAverage(vararg numbers: Int): Double {\n",
    "    if (numbers.isEmpty()) {\n",
    "        return 0.0\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    var sum = 0\n",
    "    for (num in numbers) {\n",
    "        sum += num\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return sum.toDouble() / numbers.size\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Average of 10, 20, 30: ${calculateAverage(10, 20, 30)}\")\n",
    "println(\"Average of 5, 15: ${calculateAverage(5, 15)}\")\n",
    "println(\"Average of 100: ${calculateAverage(100)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Average of 10, 20, 30: 20.0\n",
    "Average of 5, 15: 10.0\n",
    "Average of 100: 100.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining Vararg with Other Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun printReport(title: String, vararg items: String) {\n",
    "    println(\"=== $title ===\")\n",
    "    for (item in items) {\n",
    "        println(\"- $item\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "printReport(\"Shopping List\", \"Milk\", \"Bread\", \"Eggs\", \"Cheese\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "=== Shopping List ===\n",
    "- Milk\n",
    "- Bread\n",
    "- Eggs\n",
    "- Cheese\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Inline Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for beginners:** This is a more advanced topic. You don't need to fully understand it now, but it's good to know it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline functions are a performance optimization. When you mark a function as `inline`, Kotlin copies the function's code to wherever it's called, instead of actually calling the function. This makes the program slightly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "inline fun measureTime(action: () -> Unit) {\n",
    "    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\n",
    "    action()\n",
    "    val endTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\n",
    "    println(\"Time taken: ${endTime - startTime} milliseconds\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "measureTime {\n",
    "    // Some task\n",
    "    var sum = 0\n",
    "    for (i in 1..1000000) {\n",
    "        sum += i\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    println(\"Sum: $sum\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For now, just remember:** Inline functions exist and are used for performance. You'll rarely need to create them as a beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Higher-order Functions & Lambdas\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds complicated, but it's actually a very powerful and useful concept!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Higher-order Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **higher-order function** is simply a function that:\n",
    "- Takes another function as a parameter, OR\n",
    "- Returns a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like: \"A function that works with other functions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **lambda** is a quick way to write a small function without giving it a name. Think of it as an \"anonymous function\" or \"function on the go\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to perform different operations on two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {\n",
    "    return operation(a, b)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now we can use it with different operations:\n",
    "val sum = calculate(5, 3, { x, y -> x + y })\n",
    "println(\"Sum: $sum\")  // Output: Sum: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "val product = calculate(5, 3, { x, y -> x * y })\n",
    "println(\"Product: $product\")  // Output: Product: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `operation: (Int, Int) -> Int` means \"a parameter that is a function taking two Ints and returning an Int\"\n",
    "- `{ x, y -> x + y }` is a lambda - a small unnamed function that adds two numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaner Lambda Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "When a lambda is the last parameter, you can write it outside the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val sum = calculate(5, 3) { x, y -> x + y }\n",
    "val difference = calculate(10, 3) { x, y -> x - y }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Filtering a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get only even numbers\n",
    "val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { number -> number % 2 == 0 }\n",
    "println(\"Even numbers: $evenNumbers\")\n",
    "// Output: Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Get numbers greater than 5\n",
    "val bigNumbers = numbers.filter { number -> number > 5 }\n",
    "println(\"Numbers > 5: $bigNumbers\")\n",
    "// Output: Numbers > 5: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Special \"it\" Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "When your lambda has only one parameter, you can use `it` instead of naming it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Instead of:\n",
    "val doubled = numbers.map { number -> number * 2 }\n",
    "\n",
    "// You can write:\n",
    "val doubled2 = numbers.map { it * 2 }\n",
    "\n",
    "println(doubled2)  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val names = listOf(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Find all names with more than 4 letters\n",
    "val longNames = names.filter { it.length > 4 }\n",
    "println(longNames)  // Output: [Alice, Charlie, David]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Convert all names to uppercase\n",
    "val upperNames = names.map { it.uppercase() }\n",
    "println(upperNames)  // Output: [ALICE, BOB, CHARLIE, DAVID, EVE]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Check if any name starts with 'A'\n",
    "val hasA = names.any { it.startsWith(\"A\") }\n",
    "println(\"Any name starts with A: $hasA\")  // Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "// Count names with 3 letters\n",
    "val threeLetterCount = names.count { it.length == 3 }\n",
    "println(\"Names with 3 letters: $threeLetterCount\")  // Output: 2 (Bob, Eve)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Your Own Higher-order Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun repeatAction(times: Int, action: (Int) -> Unit) {\n",
    "    for (i in 1..times) {\n",
    "        action(i)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use it:\n",
    "repeatAction(5) { number ->\n",
    "    println(\"Iteration $number\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Iteration 1\n",
    "Iteration 2\n",
    "Iteration 3\n",
    "Iteration 4\n",
    "Iteration 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Extension Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension functions let you add new functions to existing types (like String, Int, List) without modifying their original code. It's like adding new abilities to something that already exists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like:\n",
    "- Adding a new feature to your phone through a software update\n",
    "- Teaching an old dog a new trick\n",
    "- Adding a new tool to your toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a function to String that adds exclamation marks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun String.addExclamation(): String {\n",
    "    return this + \"!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now you can use it on any String:\n",
    "val greeting = \"Hello\"\n",
    "println(greeting.addExclamation())  // Output: Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "fun String.addExclamation(): String {\n",
    "    return this + \"!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Now you can use it on any String:\n",
    "val greeting = \"Hello\"\n",
    "println(greeting.addExclamation())  // Output: Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "val message = \"Welcome to Kotlin\"\n",
    "println(message.addExclamation())   // Output: Welcome to Kotlin!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- `fun String.addExclamation()` - We're adding a function called `addExclamation` to the `String` type\n",
    "- `this` - Inside the extension function, `this` refers to the String object you're calling it on\n",
    "- Now every String in your program has this new ability!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Useful Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Add a function to Int to check if it's between two values\n",
    "fun Int.isBetween(min: Int, max: Int): Boolean {\n",
    "    return this >= min && this <= max\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val age = 25\n",
    "println(age.isBetween(18, 30))  // Output: true\n",
    "println(age.isBetween(30, 40))  // Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to repeat a String multiple times\n",
    "fun String.repeatTimes(count: Int): String {\n",
    "    var result = \"\"\n",
    "    for (i in 1..count) {\n",
    "        result += this\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Ha\".repeatTimes(3))  // Output: HaHaHa\n",
    "println(\"* \".repeatTimes(5))  // Output: * * * * *\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to check if a String is a valid email (simplified)\n",
    "fun String.isValidEmail(): Boolean {\n",
    "    return this.contains(\"@\") && this.contains(\".\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"user@example.com\".isValidEmail())  // Output: true\n",
    "println(\"invalid-email\".isValidEmail())     // Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "// Add a function to get first character safely\n",
    "fun String.firstCharOrDefault(default: Char = ' '): Char {\n",
    "    return if (this.isNotEmpty()) this[0] else default\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "println(\"Kotlin\".firstCharOrDefault())  // Output: K\n",
    "println(\"\".firstCharOrDefault('X'))     // Output: X\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension Functions for Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Add a function to get the second item in a list (if it exists)\n",
    "fun <T> List<T>.secondOrNull(): T? {\n",
    "    return if (this.size >= 2) this[1] else null\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "## Common Beginner Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Infinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var count = 1\n",
    "while (count <= 5) {\n",
    "    println(count)\n",
    "    // Forgot to increment count!\n",
    "}\n",
    "// This runs forever!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Always make sure your loop variable changes!\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var count = 1\n",
    "while (count <= 5) {\n",
    "    println(count)\n",
    "    count++  // Don't forget this!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Off-by-One Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// Want to print 1 to 10, but this prints 1 to 9\n",
    "for (i in 1 until 10) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `..` for inclusive ranges\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..10) {  // Includes both 1 and 10\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Forgetting Return Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    a * b  // Result is calculated but not returned!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `return`\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int): Int {\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Or use single-expression:\n",
    "fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Wrong Parameter Order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "fun divide(dividend: Int, divisor: Int) = dividend / divisor\n",
    "\n",
    "divide(2, 10)  // Oops! This calculates 2/10, not 10/2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use named arguments for clarity\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "divide(dividend = 10, divisor = 2)  // Clear: 10/2 = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 5: Modifying Collections While Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "for (num in numbers) {\n",
    "    if (num % 2 == 0) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use iterator or filter\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "numbers.removeIf { it % 2 == 0 }  // Safe way to remove items\n",

    "| Loop Type | Use When | Example |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| **for** | You know the number of iterations | Going through a list, counting 1-10 |\n",
    "| **while** | Condition-based looping | Keep asking until correct password |\n",
    "| **do-while** | Must execute at least once | Show menu at least once |\n",

    "### Functions Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- Functions let you reuse code\n",
    "- Parameters are inputs to functions\n",
    "- Return values are outputs from functions\n",
    "- Default arguments make parameters optional\n",
    "- Named arguments make code clearer\n",
    "- Extension functions add abilities to existing types\n",
    "- Lambdas are quick, unnamed functions\n",
    "- Higher-order functions work with other functions\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you understand loops and functions, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Practice, practice, practice!** Try modifying the examples\n",
    "2. **Combine concepts:** Use loops inside functions, functions inside loops\n",
    "3. **Build small projects:** Calculator, todo list, simple games\n",
    "4. **Learn about:** Classes, objects, collections, and more Kotlin features\n"
